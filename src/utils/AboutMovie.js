    overview:       `One year after a mysterious disappearance, Clover and her friends head into the remote valley where it happened, searching for answers.       Exploring an abandoned visitor center, they find themselves stalked by a masked killer and horrifically murdered one by one... only to wake up and find themselves back at the beginning of the same evening.       Trapped in a time loop within the valley, they're forced to relive the nightmare again and again. Each time, the killer threat is different, each more terrifying than the last.       Hope dwindling, the group soon realizes they have a limited number of "deaths" left, and the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.       The film is an adaptation of the 2015 video game by PlayStation Studios, set in the same universe but featuring an original standalone story.`    ,

  "overview": `
    Set against the backdrop of Srikakulam's coastal fishing community, Thandel (meaning 'Captain of the boat') is a romantic action thriller
    inspired by a real-life incident from 2018. The story revolves around the deep love between Raju, a brave fisherman and 'Thandel' (Naga Chaitanya),
    and his sweetheart Satya (Sai Pallavi). Despite Satya's worries about the dangers of the sea, Raju embarks on a fishing expedition.
    However, a massive storm pushes his boat and crew into Pakistani international waters, leading to their capture and imprisonment on
    charges of espionage. The film follows Raju's struggle for survival and his desperate longing to return home, while Satya, back in India,
    fights tirelessly and with great resilience to secure the release of her love and the other fishermen, a journey that tests their love,
    patriotism, and the strength of their community.

In the present day, Francis Theodore (Suriya), a bounty hunter in Goa, encounters a mysterious child named Zeta, a test subject who escaped a Russian facility. The child's presence triggers flashbacks in Francis, revealing his past life as *Kanguva* (Suriya), a fierce warrior and prince in the year 1070. Kanguva was the son of a chieftain of the Perumaachi tribe, which was under threat from both Roman soldiers and the rival clan led by the menacing chieftain *Udhiran* (Bobby Deol). A selfless sacrifice by a young boy named Poruva saves Kanguva's life, leading Kanguva to vow to dedicate his future life to protecting him. The present-day Francis realizes he is the reincarnation of Kanguva, and the boy Zeta is the reincarnation of Poruva, while a new enemy is revealed to be the reincarnation of Udhiran's vengeful illegitimate son. Francis must now protect the boy, fulfilling an ancient promise, as the battle from the past repeats itself in the modern era.",

However, she is eventually drawn to his positive attitude and determination, and falls deeply in love with him. The romance faces obstacles, particularly from Achamma's family, who object to her marrying a blind man. The movie is a message-driven story about love being blind and rising above physical disabilities.",

    Cennet was abandoned by her mother as a newborn and was lovingly raised by her grandmother in humble circumstances. Despite her difficult past, she grows up to be a brilliant and ambitious architect, graduating at the top of her class. She lands her dream job at a prestigious architecture firm owned by Arzu Soyer, the mother of her jealous schoolmate, Melisa.

    At the firm, Cennet unexpectedly reunites with Selim, her childhood best friend whom she had long been separated from. As Cennet and Selim are drawn to each other, a major revelation unfolds: Arzu, Melisa's mother, is Cennet's biological mother who abandoned her as a baby. Instead of maternal affection, Arzu, fearing the disruption of her current life and her daughter's planned marriage to Selim, plots to get rid of Cennet. The story centers on themes of abandonment, love, class divide, revenge, and the complex relationship between a mother and her abandoned daughter.

    The series is an untold story about the childhood of Lord Shiva, known as 'Baal Roop' (Child form). 
    It focuses on the beautiful and eternal bond between the young Lord Shiva and his mother, Mahasati Anusuya. 
    According to the myth, Lord Shiva takes the form of a child to fulfill the unfulfilled wish of Mahasati Anusuya 
    —the wife of sage Atri—to experience maternal love and raise him, as his divine duties and nature as an eternal hermit 
    had previously prevented him from having a childhood. His incarnation as Baal Shiv occurs after the Holy Trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva) 
    come to test Anusuya's virtue and chastity.
